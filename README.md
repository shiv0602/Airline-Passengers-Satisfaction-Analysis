Analyzed an Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset, identifying the key factors that were contributing to a recent dip in customer satisfaction rates by designing a Power BI dashboard report and recommending a data-driven strategy for increasing overall satisfaction rates. The insights gained from this project helped the airline take necessary action to improve their customer satisfaction rates and enhance the overall travel experience for passengers.
# Project Details
The airline industry is highly competitive, and customer satisfaction is a key factor that determines the success of an airline. The airline's leadership team has identified a recent dip in passenger satisfaction ratings which prompted them (the leadership team) to seek recommendations for a data-driven strategy to increase overall satisfaction rates.

The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset of airline passenger satisfaction scores to identify key factors that contributed to the low satisfaction rates and focus on getting back on track. The dataset used for this analysis contains feedback from over 120,100 airline passengers, including additional information about each passenger, their flight, and type of travel, as well as their evaluation of different factors such as cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.

The project involved analyzing the dataset to identify key factors that were contributing to the recent dip in satisfaction rates. This analysis included calculating several key performance indicators such as total passengers, average arrival and departure delays, and satisfaction and dissatisfaction rates.

The analysis revealed several key findings, including a higher percentage of dissatisfied customers, longer average arrival and departure delays, and lower satisfaction rates in certain areas such as cleanliness, legroom, gate location and other services like In-flight Wi-Fi Service and Ease of Online Booking.

Based on these findings, I recommended a data-driven strategy for increasing overall satisfaction rates. This strategy included several key recommendations such as improving In-flight Wi-Fi Service, Ease of Online Booking, and convenient and accessible Gate Locations for smooth boarding by using technology such as mobile apps and digital displays. Additionally, I also recommended improving the cleanliness and legroom comfort of the airline's planes, reducing delays, and providing better customer service.

To present the findings and recommendations to the airline's leadership team, I designed a Power BI dashboard report. The report included visualizations of key performance indicators, and average ratings of the services offered by the airline and provided an overview of the analysis, key findings, and recommended strategy.

The insights gained from this project will help the airline take necessary action to improve their customer satisfaction rates and enhance the overall travel experience for passengers. The airline can use the recommendations to prioritize areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to stay competitive in the industry.
# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
KPIs are measurable values that organizations use to track and evaluate their progress towards achieving specific business objectives. They are used to measure performance over time and allow organizations to make data-driven decisions based on actual results. KPIs are specific to the objectives of an organization or department and can be qualitative or quantitative. They are important metrics that help organizations identify areas for improvement, set targets for future performance, and track their success in meeting their goals.
